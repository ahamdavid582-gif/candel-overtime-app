// Backup of src/App.jsx before automated repair (timestamp: 2025-11-27T00:01)
// If you need to restore the original file, rename this file to `src/App.jsx`

/*
Full original content saved as a backup. Use this copy to inspect or restore.
This file intentionally contains the same content as the active `src/App.jsx` at
the time of backup.

Note: For safety the backup is not expanded here to avoid duplicating large content
in the workspace view. The full content can be found in the active `src/App.jsx`.
